# gimkit-code-finder
Find random Gimkit games currently in progress.

This js script will use brute force to find Gimkit games that are being played. It can be funny to join someones Gimkit game without their knowing and see their reaction. 

How to use:
Copy the codew and turn it into a bookmarklet. Run the bookmarklet while at gimkit.com/join. The time it takes to find a code can vary from almost instantly to over 1 minute. When it is done, it will give you an alert with the code. Copy the code and paste it into the "game code" text box. Then enter your name and you should be in the game!
